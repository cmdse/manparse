        <para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            translates documents written in troff macros to DocBook. Structural subsets of the requests in
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>man</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mdoc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ms</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>me</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mm</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>, and
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>troff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
            are supported.</para>

        <para>The translation brings over all the structure of the original document at section, subsection, and paragraph level. Command and C function synopses are translated into DocBook markup, not just a verbatim display. Tables (TBL markup) are translated into DocBook table markup. PIC diagrams are translated into SVG. Troff-level information that might have structural implications is preserved in XML comments.</para>

        <para>Where possible, font-change macros are translated into structural markup.
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            recognizes stereotyped patterns of markup and content (such as the use of italics in a FILES section to mark filenames) and lifts them. A means to edit, add, and save semantic hints about highlighting is supported.</para>

        <para>Some cliches are recognized and lifted to structural markup even without highlighting. Patterns recognized include such things as URLs, email addresses, man page references, and C program listings.</para>

        <para>The tag
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>.in</emphasis>
            and
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>.ti</emphasis>
            requests are passed through with complaints. They indicate presentation-level markup that
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            cannot translate into structure; the output will require hand-fixing.</para>

        <para>The tag
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>.ta</emphasis>
            is passed through with a complaint unless the immediarely following by text lines contains a tab, in which case the following span of lines containing tabs is lifted to a table.</para>

        <para>Under some circumstances,
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            can even lift formatted manual pages and the text output produced by
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lynx</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
            from HTML. If it finds no macros in the input, but does find a NAME section header, it tries to interpret the plain text as a manual page (skipping boilerplate headers and footers generated by
            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lynx</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>). Translations produced in this way will be prone to miss structural features, but this fallback is good enough for simple man pages.</para>

        <para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            does not do a perfect job, merely a surprisingly good one. Final polish should be applied by a human being capable of recognizing patterns too subtle for a computer. But
            <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
            will almost always produce translations that are good enough to be usable before hand-hacking.</para>
