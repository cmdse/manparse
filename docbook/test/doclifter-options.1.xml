            acts as a filter, translating troff source input on standard input to DocBook markup on standard output. If called with arguments, each argument file is translated separately (but hints are retained, see below); the suffix
            .xml
            is given to the translated output.</para>

                allows you to post a hint. This may be useful, for example, if
                <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
                is mis-parsing a synopsis because it doesnt recognize a token as a command. This hint is merged after hints in the input source have been read.

                allows you to set a comma-separated list of encodings to be looked for in the input. The default is "ISO-8859-1,UTF-8", which should cover almost all cases.

            <para>Normally, requests that
                <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>doclifter</emphasis>
                could not interpret (usually because theyre presentation-level) are passed through to XML comments in the output. The -q option suppresses this. It also suppresses listing of macros. Messages about requests that are unrecognized or cannot be translated go to standard error whatever the state of this option. This option is intended to reduce clutter when you believe you have a clean lift of a document and want to lose the troff legacy.
